### The official note on the itslearning

You can form teams of at most 3 students. You can work alone but we encourage everyone to be
part of a team. Team members can be from different sections.

- Codes should be written in C++. You are allowed to use C++ standard library. No other library
can be used.
- In the project report you should clearly explain the data structures and algorithms you used. Also, you should clearly write which parts of the project you completed. Also, provide the time it takes to make all the predictions (omit the time for reading the ratings file). Designing efficient data structures and algorithms will lead to higher grades, so describe them in detail.
- You should submit a video recording in which every team member should explain his/her part. Recordings should be about 10-15 minutes long. You should submit (to itslearning) the following as three separate files in the given formats. Submissions in other formats will not be evaluated. Every team should make a single submission so write team member names clearly at the top of your reports.

There will be a penalty of -10 points for every late day after the due date.

• All header (.h) and source (.cpp) files. (zip format)
• Project report (PDF format)
• Video recording (mp4 format)

### About competition

The competition is evaluated on the root mean squared error (RMSE).
